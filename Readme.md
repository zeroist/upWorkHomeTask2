## **UPWORK** - _Documentation of Test Cases_

This project has been created for answering the case study problems from `UPWORK` by `YUSUF OLGUN` from scratch.

* Study tasks which are requested on `UPWORK` have been created by using Selenium and Java and their automation steps have been completed.

* The TASK solution can be found under `~src/test/java/com/upwork~` .Under this folder
  There are three folders
  1. ``pages`` Folder Where I implement Page object Model
  2. ``tests`` Folder. In this folder I created SearchFunctionality Class in which you are going to run Test.
  3. ``utilities`` Folder Where I implement Singleton Design pattern in Driver Class


* The maven dependency of `selenium-java` has been used and needs to be
added in POM.xml file.
* The browser to be used **must be installed** on the computer where the tests will be run. Please check the `configuration.properties` file.
* The creation of the java files under the `utilities` package and the structures in them are entirely owned by the
  creator of this project.
* In order to configure Search text (keyword) and browser you can use ``configuration.properties`` file in the root.
